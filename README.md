# WMAP
R package WMAP (Weighted Meta-Analysis using Pseudo-populations) implements integrative weighting approaches for multiple observational studies and causal inferences about various groups of subjects introduced in “Causal Meta-Analysis by Integrating Multiple Observational Studies with Multivariate Outcomes” (Guha and Li, 2004; Biometrics). Subharup Guha, Mengqi Xu, Kashish Priyam, and Yi Li created the package.

View the script file “demoAnalyze.R” to install the package and run examples for computing balancing weights for a pseudo-population (Stage 1 analysis) and implementing causal inferences (Stage 2 analysis). Please refer to Guha and Li (2004) for the methodology details.
